- The z-statistic files included in this folder are de-identified data from 22 adults who completed the Auditory Language Localizer Task (for more info: http://web.mit.edu/evlab//funcloc/). 
- Data in the regular data is in 65 x 77 x 60 space (3 x 3 x 3.3)
- Data in the resampled data folder is in 78 x 93 x 71 space (2.5 x 2.5 x 2.75). **This data matches the dimensions of the Statistical Learning task**.
- Contrasts are from intact > degraded speech.
- T1w data was manually corrected using Freesurfer  and functional data was pre-processed using fMRI prep (https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep)
- Subsequent analyses were all conducted in FSL.
