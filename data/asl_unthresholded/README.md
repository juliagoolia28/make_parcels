# Auditory Statistical Learning Paradigm

- The z-statistic files included in this folder are de-identified data from 22 adults who completed the Auditory Language Localizer Task (for more info: http://web.mit.edu/evlab//funcloc/). 
- Contrasts are from intact > degraded speech.
- T1w data was manually corrected using Freesurfer  and functional data was pre-processed using fMRI prep (https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep)
- Subsequent analyses were all conducted in FSL.
